# Lighthouse4u

[![travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/godaddy/lighthouse4u.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/godaddy/lighthouse4u)

LH4U provides [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) as a service, surfaced by both a friendly UI+API, and backed by various
[storage](#storage-clients) and [queue](#queue-clients) clients to support a wide range of architectures.


![UI](./docs/example.gif)

## Usage

Start server via CLI:

```
npm i -g lighthouse4u
lh4u server --config local --config-dir ./app/config --config-base defaults --secure-config ./app/config/secure --secure-file some-private.key
```

Or locally to this repo via `npm start` (you'll need to create `test/config/local.json5` by copying `test/config/COPY.json5`).


## Architectures

With the release of v1, we've decoupled compute and storage into multiple tiers to permit a diverse set of
architectures. Not only are custom [storage](#storage-clients) and [queue](#queue-clients) clients
supported, but compute can even be run serverless.

### Queue Architecture

This most closely resembles that of `v0.7`, but without the restrictions of being locked into Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ.

```
{  
  reader: {
    module: 'lighthouse4u-elasticsearch', options: { /* ... */ }
  },
  writer: {
    module: 'lighthouse4u-elasticsearch', options: { /* ... */ }
  },
  queue: { // rabbit
    module: 'lighthouse4u-amqp', options: { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `lighthouse4u-elasticsearch` storage client is not yet available. Happy to take contributions!


### Serverless Architecture

Same as above, you're not tied to Elasticsearch. Use whatever
[storage](#storage-clients) and [queue](#queue-clients) client fits your needs. Due to the nature
of AWS Lambda, your Lighthouse "runner" (triggered via SQS) is separate from the Lighthouse4u UI+API.

### Command


## Storage Clients

* [AWS S3](https://github.com/godaddy/lighthouse4u/tree/master/packages/lighthouse4u-s3) - Store and basic query
  support via S3 buckets.
* [File System](https://github.com/godaddy/lighthouse4u/tree/master/packages/lighthouse4u-fs) - Not recommended
  for production usage. Good for local testing.
* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/godaddy/lighthouse4u/tree/master/packages/lighthouse4u-es) - Store and query
  support via Elasticsearch.


## Queue Clients

* [AWS SQS](https://github.com/godaddy/lighthouse4u/tree/master/packages/lighthouse4u-sqs) - Support for
  Simple Queue Service.
* [AMQP](https://github.com/godaddy/lighthouse4u/tree/master/packages/lighthouse4u-amqp) - Support for
  RabbitMQ and other AMQP compatible queues.


## Secure Configuration

Optionally you may run LH4U with the `--secure-config {secureConfigPath}` and `--secure-file {securePrivateFile}` powered by [Config Shield](https://github.com/godaddy/node-config-shield).

```
npm i -g config-shield
cshield ./app/config/secure some-private.key
> help
> set queue { options: { url: 'amqp://lh4u_user:someSuperSecretPassword@rmq.on-my-domain.com:5672/lh4u' } }
> get queue
: { "options": { "url": "amqp://lh4u_user:someSuperSecretPassword@rmq.on-my-domain.com:5672/lh4u" } }
> save
> exit
```

The example above will allow you to merge sensitive credentials with your existing public configuration. Only options defined in the secure config will be deeply merged.
